# This module checks for Mac Homebrew, MacPorts, or Fink, in that order, on Mac
# OS X.
#
# It will prepend the active package manager's paths to:
#
# CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
# CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
# CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
#
# In addition, the following commands are called with the package manager's
# paths:
#
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()
# LINK_DIRECTORIES()
#
# The paths of package managers not currently in $ENV{PATH} are added to
# CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH .
