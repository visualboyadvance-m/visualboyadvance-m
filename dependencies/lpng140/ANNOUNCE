Changes since the last public release (1.2.10):

version 1.4.0 [January 3, 2010]

  Enabled iTXt support (changes png_struct, thus requires so-number change).
  Cleaned up PNG_ASSEMBLER_CODE_SUPPORTED vs PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED
  Eliminated PNG_1_0_X and PNG_1_2_X macros.
  Removed deprecated functions png_read_init, png_write_init, png_info_init,
    png_permit_empty_plte, png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8, and removed the
    deprecated macro PNG_MAX_UINT.
  Moved "PNG_INTERNAL" parts of png.h and pngconf.h into pngintrn.h
  Removed all  WIN32_WCE #ifdefs except those involving the
    time.h "tm" structure (Cosmin)
  Reduced dependency on C-runtime library when on Windows (Simon-Pierre)
  Replaced sprintf() with png_sprintf() (Simon-Pierre)
  Revised makefiles to avoid making links to libpng.so.*
  Added a note in libpng.txt that png_set_sig_bytes(8) can be used when
    writing an embedded PNG without the 8-byte signature.
  Updated scripts/pngos2.def, pngw32.def, and projects/wince/png32ce.def
  Added PNG_NO_GET_INT_32 and PNG_NO_SAVE_INT_32 macros.
  Scripts/libpng.pc.in contained "configure" style version info and would
    not work with makefiles.
  Increased sprintf buffer from 50 to 52 chars in pngrutil.c to avoid
    buffer overflow.
  Fixed bug in example.c (png_set_palette_rgb -> png_set_palette_to_rgb))
  Changed sonum from 0 to 1.
  Removed unused prototype for png_check_sig() from png.h
  Prepended "#! /bin/sh" to ltmail.sh and contrib/pngminus/*.sh (Cosmin).
  Avoided potential buffer overflow and optimized buffer in
    png_write_sCAL(), png_write_sCAL_s() (Cosmin).

    in scripts/makefile.gcc (Nelson A. de Oliveira, Cosmin).
  Exported png_write_sig (Cosmin).
  Optimized buffer in png_handle_cHRM() (Cosmin).
  Allow zero-length IDAT chunks after the entire zlib datastream, but not
    after another intervening chunk type.
  Set pHYs = 2835 x 2835 pixels per meter, and added
    pngtest now produces, and made some cosmetic changes to pngtest output.
    sCAL = 0.352778e-3 x 0.352778e-3 meters, in pngtest.png (Cosmin).

  Added one zero element to png_gamma_shift[] array in pngrtran.c to avoid
    reading out of bounds.
  Added demonstration of user chunk support in pngtest.c, to support the
    public sTER chunk and a private vpAg chunk.
  Removed ordinals from scripts/pngw32.def and removed png_info_int and

    to png_size_t (Cosmin).
  Removed png_convert_size() and replaced png_sizeof with sizeof (Cosmin).
  Removed some unnecessary type casts (Cosmin).

  Clarified that png_zalloc() does not clear the allocated memory,
    and png_zalloc() and png_zfree() cannot be PNGAPI (Cosmin).
  Renamed png_mem_size_t to png_alloc_size_t, fixed its definition in
    pngconf.h, and used it in all memory allocation functions (Cosmin).

    can be free'ed in case of error.  Revised unknown chunk handling in
    pngrutil.c and pngpread.c to use this structure.
  Prefer PNG_USE_PNGVCRD when _MSC_VER is defined in pngconf.h
  Revised pngvcrd.c for improved efficiency.
  Moved local array "chunkdata" from pngrutil.c to the png_struct, so
    it will be freed by png_read_destroy() in case of a read error (Kurt
    Christensen).
  Change "purpose" and "buffer" to png_ptr->chunkdata to avoid memory leaking.
  Change all  "chunkdata" to "png_ptr->chunkdata" in png_decompress_chunk(),

  Added png_check_cHRM in png.c and moved checking from pngget.c, pngrutil.c,
    and pngwrite.c
  Added check for zero-area RGB cHRM triange in png_check_cHRM() and
    png_check_cHRM_fixed().
  Revised png_warning() to write its message on standard output by default
    when warning_fn is NULL.
  Eliminated png_check_cHRM().  Instead, always use png_check_cHRM_fixed().
  In png_check_cHRM_fixed(), ensure white_y is > 0, and removed redundant
    check for all-zero coordinates that is detected by the triangle check.
  Rearranged test expressions in png_check_cHRM_fixed() to avoid internal
    overflows.
  Added PNG_NO_CHECK_cHRM conditional.
  Fixed string vs pointer-to-string error in png_check_keyword().
  Added PNG_NO_CHECK_cHRM conditional.
  Merge png_debug with version 1.2.34beta04.

    reading an interlaced file, to avoid a possible UMR.

    documentation
  Relocated misplaced #endif in pngwrite.c, sCAL chunk handler.
  Conditionally compile png_read_finish_row() which is not used by
    progressive readers.
  Added contrib/pngminim/preader to demonstrate building minimal progressive
    decoder, based on contrib/gregbook with embedded libpng and zlib.
  In contrib/pngminim/*, renamed "makefile.std" to "makefile", since there
    is only one makefile in those directories, and revised the README files
    accordingly.

    configure scripts to detect the presence of libpng.
  Revised libpng*.txt and libpng.3 to mention calling png_set_IHDR()
    multiple times and to specify the sample order in the tRNS chunk,
    because the ISO PNG specification has a typo in the tRNS table.
  Changed several PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNK_SUPPORTED to
    PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED, to make the png_set_keep mechanism
    available for ignoring known chunks even when not saving unknown chunks.
  Adopted preference for consistent use of "#ifdef" and "#ifndef" versus
    "#if defined()" and "if !defined()" where possible.

  Replaced *.tar.lzma with *.tar.xz in distribution.  Get the xz codec
    from <http://tukaani.org/xz>.

    png_struct or info_struct members and other deprecated usage in
    applications (John Bowler).
  Updated scripts/makefile* to add "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" to CFLAGS,
    to prevent warnings about direct access to png structs by libpng
    functions while building libpng.  They need to be tested, especially
    those using compilers other than gcc.
  Updated CMakeLists.txt to add "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" to the definitions.
  Updated projects/visualc6 and visualc71 with "/d PNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG".
    They should work but still need to be updated to remove
    references to pnggccrd.c or pngvcrd.c and ASM building.
  Added README.txt to the beos, cbuilder5, netware, and xcode projects warning
    that they need to be updated, to remove references to pnggccrd.c and
    pngvcrd.c and to depend on pngpriv.h
  Removed three direct references to read_info_ptr members in pngtest.c
    that were detected by the new PNG_DEPSTRUCT macro.

  Added dependency on pngpriv.h in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Revised Makefile.am to use libpng.sys while building libpng.so
    so that only PNG_EXPORT functions are exported.
  Removed the deprecated png_check_sig() function/macro.
  Removed recently removed function names from scripts/*.def
  Added PNG_PRIVATE macro definition in pngconf.h for possible future use.
  Removed projects/beos and netware.txt; no one seems to be supporting them.
  Moved libpng-config.in and libpng.pc-configure.in out of the scripts
    directory, to libpng-config.in and libpng.pc.in, respectively, and
    modified Makefile.am and configure.ac accordingly.  Now "configure"
    needs nothing from the "scripts" directory.
  Removed ASM builds from projects/visualc6 and projects/visualc71
  Removed scripts/makefile.nommx and makefile.vcawin32
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to account for new location of libpng-config.in
    and libpng.pc.in

  Removed obsolete comments about ASM from projects/visualc71/README_zlib.txt
  Align row_buf on 16-byte boundary in memory.
  Make the 'png_jmpbuf' macro expand to a call that records the correct
    longjmp function as well as returning a pointer to the setjmp
    jmp_buf buffer, and marked direct access to jmpbuf 'deprecated'.
    (John Bowler)
  Changed "/255" to "/255.0" in background calculations to make it clear
    that the 255 is used as a double.
  Added "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" in the libpng source files.
  Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
    to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng14 instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng14.
  Added "bit_depth" parameter to the private png_build_gamma_table() function.
  Use png_calloc() instead of png_malloc(); png_memset() in pngrutil.c
  Avoid deprecated references to png_ptr-io_ptr and png_ptr->error_ptr
    in pngtest.c
