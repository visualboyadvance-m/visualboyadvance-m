    If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version
    of the file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to

    As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
    part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
    parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
    as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
    the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
    special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
    Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
    License without this special exception.
 .
    This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
    version 2.2 of Bison.
