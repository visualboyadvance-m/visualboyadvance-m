rem ===========================================================================
rem  setup.bat  -  configure a DLSS-NR release to run a game (Windows)
rem
rem  This ships INSIDE the release folder, next to the built layer and the runtime.
rem  It is the last step a user runs; nothing here compiles anything.
rem
rem    1. Find nvngx_dlssnr.dll. Three ways, in the order offered:
rem         a) one sitting next to this script  (drag the pack into a game folder
rem            and drop the DLL beside it - the common case)
rem         b) a folder you pick, searched for the file
rem            (no download: the DLL is NVIDIA's, and this script will not fetch it)
rem            already have it
rem       Nothing is redistributed: the DLL is NVIDIA's and the sizes below are the
rem       only thing checked about it.
rem    2. Extract the logical weights from that DLL (needs Python 3 with NumPy and
rem       safetensors; the script says so and stops if they are missing).
rem    3. Install the layer: copy it under a name you choose, write the manifest so
rem       its library_path is that file, and write a launcher that points the daemon
rem       at this folder.
rem
rem  Usage:
rem    setup.bat                          configure a game folder chosen interactively
rem    setup.bat --game "C:\Games\MyGame"
rem    setup.bat --game ... --dll X:\path\nvngx_dlssnr.dll
rem    setup.bat --game ... --name nr_layer.dll
rem    setup.bat --game ... --skip-weights
