#  setup.sh  -  configure a DLSS-NR release to run a game (Linux / macOS)
#
#  Ships inside the release folder, next to the built layer and the runtime. It is the
#  last step a user runs; nothing here compiles anything.
#
#    1. Find nvngx_dlssnr.dll. Three ways, in the order offered:
#         a) one sitting next to this script
#         b) a folder you pick, searched for the file
#            (no download: the DLL is NVIDIA's, and this script will not fetch it)
#    2. Extract the logical weights from that DLL (needs Python 3 with NumPy and
#       safetensors).
#    3. Install the layer: copy it under a name you choose, write the manifest so its
#       library_path is that file, and write a launcher pointing the daemon at this
#       folder.
#
#  Usage:
#    ./setup.sh --game /path/to/Game
#    ./setup.sh --game ... --dll /path/to/nvngx_dlssnr.dll
#    ./setup.sh --game ... --name libnr_layer.so --skip-weights
