/*
 * nr_frame — one RGB frame in, one RGB frame out, through the recovered graph, in C.
 *
 * The C library that `src/ref/nr_frame.py` is: the same 16-channel feature assembly,
 * the same 71-block graph recorded against `libxmx` dispatch for dispatch as
 * `nr_frame_resident.py` records it, the same head-to-RGB composition. The head it
 * produces is bit-identical to the Python resident path on the same device — the
 * dispatches are the same, so the bytes are — and `src/ref/test_nr_frame_c.py` checks
 * that. The three places it can differ from NumPy by the last bit are named where they
 * happen: the noise channels, the temporal gate's exponential, and the detail blur.
 *
 * Images are float32 RGB in [0, 1], row-major (height, width, 3); the head is
 * (height, width, 4). One `nr_frame` holds the weights on the device and the graph for
 * the most recent extent; a new extent rebuilds the graph and keeps the weights.
 *
 * The host passes around the graph — feature assembly, the composition and its temporal
 * gate and floor, the detail blur — split their rows across nr_image.c's thread pool, one
 * thread per core (`NR_HOST_THREADS`, else `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, to change it, 1 for none).
 * The bytes do not depend on the count. The temporal gate is a 65536-entry table over the
 * half logit, built once per blend scale, as `nr_frame.gate_table` is in the Python.
 *
 *     nr_frame *f = nr_frame_open("work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors");   // or NULL: the weights compiled in
 *     nr_frame_params p; nr_frame_defaults(&p);
 *     nr_frame_update(f, colour, height, width, NULL, NULL, &p, output, NULL);
