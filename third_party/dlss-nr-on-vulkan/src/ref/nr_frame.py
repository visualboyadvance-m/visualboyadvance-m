    """The head over the frame. Post-network and cheap: sweep it without re-running.

    With a `history` image this is MLX-DLSS's `compose_temporal` instead of its
    `compose_head`: the model's own gate decides, per pixel, how much of the previous
    output survives into this one. `history_confidence` scales that gate globally —
    0 is the still-frame path exactly, 1 is the model's own answer.

    The vendor reads the history back out of feature channels 7-9, which pins it to the
    network's extent; a live frame composes at the *output* extent, so it arrives here
    as an image instead. That skips one `scaled_color` round trip through fp16, worth
    at most 0.06 of a 0-255 level, and keeps the game's own pixels off the resampler.

    `history_floor` raises the gate per pixel rather than lowering it, which the vendor
    has no need of and we do. The gate is not local: on a frame where most things move it
    reads 0.12 even over pixels that did not move, against 0.705 on a scene where the
    history was correct everywhere (`notes/phase54-flicker-fix.md`, `phase12`). A caller
    that can prove the history is correct for a pixel — because the game handed back the
    same bytes — can say so here. The floor is still bounded by `blend_scale`, so no
    pixel is held harder than the model itself ever holds one.

    `history_release` is the other half of the same signal: where the game's pixel changed
    by `history_release` levels of 255 or more, none of the gate survives, and by less, a
    share that falls linearly with the change. Without motion vectors the history at a
    pixel something moved across is what was there before, and a gate that reads 0.6 over
    a whole Tekken frame kept a trail of it behind everything that moved. It lowers only
    the gate — never the floor, which is zero wherever the game changed a pixel anyway.

    `intensity` blends the model's picture against the source, per pixel when a
    ControlMask supplies its red channel. `detail_strength` and `colour_strength`
    then re-weight the high and low frequencies of whatever change remains.

    Above 1 the blend extrapolates past the model's own picture. MLX-DLSS's
    `compose_head` clamps it, so anything over 1 was silently a no-op here; the
    vendor's panel goes to 2 and ships screenshots at 1.66
    (`notes/phase30-control-atlas.md`). At or below 1 this is bit-identical to the
    clamped path — the extrapolation only replaces the final blend, and the residual,
    its half rounding and the [0,1] clamp on the result are unchanged.

    `grade`, from `grade_for`, is the vendor's colour grade for a style, and `neural`, an
    array of the colour's shape, receives what the vendor keeps as the next frame's
    history: the prediction after the history's blend and before the grade, the intensity
    or anything else, truncated to half. The grade reads that same half value, as the
    vendor's post-process reads it back out of its RGBA16F scratch
    (`notes/phase70-post-process.md`). With neither, nothing here changes by a bit.
