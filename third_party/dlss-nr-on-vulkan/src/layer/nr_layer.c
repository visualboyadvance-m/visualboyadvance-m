 * nr_layer — a Vulkan layer that hands the presented frame to DLSS-NR.
 *
 * Why a Vulkan layer, and not the route everyone else takes.
 *
 * Every published way of getting DLSS-NR into a game — OptiScaler's fork, the
 * ReShade bridges, the dual-GPU MGPU Bridge — loads NVIDIA's own nvngx_dlssnr.dll
 * and therefore needs an NVIDIA GPU (or, for the AMD lab, a PTX translation of it).
 * None of them can run here. What we have instead is a reimplementation that is
 * already Vulkan compute.
 *
 * And under Proton a DX12 game goes DX12 -> VKD3D-Proton -> Vulkan on ANV, which is
 * the same driver our shaders run on. So the frame we want is already a VkImage on
 * the device we already use: no D3D interop, no Windows DLL, no PCIe transfer. A
 * layer at vkQueuePresentKHR sees it. vkBasalt has done exactly this on Linux for
 * years, so the shape is proven.
 *
 * This file is the capture half: chain into the loader, force TRANSFER_SRC onto the
 * swapchain images, and copy the presented frame out on demand.
 *
 * Build: cc -O2 -shared -fPIC -o libnr_layer.so nr_layer.c -lvulkan
