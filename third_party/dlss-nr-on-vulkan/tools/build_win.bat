rem ===========================================================================
rem  build_win.bat  -  build the Windows runtime, layer and shaders into work/
rem
rem  Three artefacts, all with MSVC:
rem    work\libxmx.dll      the resident Vulkan runtime the daemon drives
rem    work\nr_layer.dll    the Vulkan layer the game loads
rem    work\*.spv           the compute shaders
rem
rem  Two things here are not obvious and both cost an afternoon if missed:
rem
rem    * libxmx.c needs /std:c11. It uses _Static_assert, which MSVC's default C
rem      dialect does not accept - the build fails with a page of syntax errors
rem      pointing at the asserts rather than at the flag.
rem    * MSVC exports nothing from a DLL unless told to. libxmx's export list is
rem      generated from the source (every non-static xmx_* definition) so a symbol
rem      added later cannot silently go missing from the DLL, which is a failure
rem      the Python side only reports as "function 'xmx_...' not found".
rem
rem  Usage:  build_win.bat            build everything
rem          build_win.bat --layer    only the layer (fast; what deploy needs)
rem          build_win.bat --shaders  only the shaders

rem The host-side passes around the network. Without it those passes fall back to NumPy,

rem points. The export list is generated for the same reason as libxmx's.

rem /TP and /openmp together, and both are needed: MSVC's /openmp rejects a #pragma omp
rem parallel for in C mode outright (C3015 on the canonical sample, in /TC), and compiles
rem it in C++ mode. So this one file goes through the C++ front end. The only C-isms that
rem costs are explicit casts from malloc, added for it. Without OpenMP every host pass runs
rem on one core: 212-216 ms of replayed graph at 720p against 191-195 with gcc's OpenMP.

rem No per-driver defines. Intel's Windows compiler folds half_round's packHalf2x16 round
rem trip to x (90109 of 90368 values on the B580's 101.8993, the same on the Arc 140V's
rem 101.9033), so libxmx gives every pipeline the float16_t cast there instead, from the
rem driver it finds, through specialisation constant 1. The attention shaders' softmax
rem uses packHalf2x16 only as a bit trick on the packed word, which the fold does not touch.
rem
rem Two sources, not one: the runtime's shaders live in src/gpu and the probe in src/bench,
rem and the Makefile builds both. A missing source is an error here rather than a quiet
rem skip - looking only in src/gpu once made `call :shader half_probe` fall through in
rem silence, and a daemon spawned by the layer then died on the next thing that assumed it.
