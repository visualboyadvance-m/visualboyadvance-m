rem ===========================================================================
rem  deploy.bat  -  run DLSS-NR on Intel against a game (Windows)
rem
rem  One script for the whole setup: weights, build, install.
rem
rem    1. weights  - runs scripts/get_weights.py against a DLL you supply (--dll), which
rem                  clones MLX-DLSS at its pinned commit and writes
rem                  work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors. Skipped with --skip-weights,
rem                  or when the file is already there.
rem    2. build    - tools/build_win.bat builds libxmx.dll, nr_layer.dll and the shaders.
rem    3. install  - copies the layer into the game folder under a name you choose, writes
rem                  a manifest whose library_path is that file's absolute path, copies the
rem                  runtime the daemon needs, and writes a launcher.
rem
rem  What it deliberately does not do:
rem
rem    * It does NOT copy the model weights anywhere. The launcher points the daemon at
rem      this checkout with NR_ROOT, so the weights stay in work/mlxw/ and nothing large
rem      can be passed on by accident with the game folder. Extract them wherever this
rem      tree is; the game folder only needs to know where to look.
rem    * It DOES copy the runtime the daemon needs to start: work/mlx-dlss (the MLX
rem      extractor the daemon imports), libxmx.dll, libnr_image.dll and the shaders.
rem      Without them the daemon stops at start.
rem
rem  Why the manifest matters: the Vulkan loader finds a layer through its manifest
rem  plus VK_LAYER_PATH, not through the DLL search order, so the manifest has to name
rem  the file and VK_LAYER_PATH has to point at the folder holding both. That is also
rem  why the default name is NOT version.dll: on Windows a module called version.dll,
rem  once loaded, is what later imports of version.dll resolve to, so it can silently
rem  stand in for the system library. The manifest makes the name irrelevant anyway.
rem
rem  Usage:
rem    deploy.bat --game "C:\Games\MyGame" --dll X:\path\nvngx_dlssnr.dll
rem              [--name nr_layer.dll] [--exe "C:\Games\MyGame\game.exe"]
