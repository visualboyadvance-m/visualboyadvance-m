#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ============================================================================
#  deploy.sh  -  run DLSS-NR on Intel against a game (Linux / macOS)
#
#  One script for the whole setup: weights, build, install.
#
#    1. weights  - runs scripts/get_weights.py against a DLL you supply (--dll), which
#                  clones MLX-DLSS at its pinned commit and writes
#                  work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors. Skipped with --skip-weights,
#                  or when the file is already there.
#    2. build    - make builds libxmx.so, libnr_layer.so, libnr_image.so and the shaders.
#    3. install  - copies the layer into the game folder next to a manifest whose
#                  library_path is ./ and its name, copies the runtime the daemon needs,
#                  and writes a launcher.
#
#  What it deliberately does not do:
#
#    * It does NOT copy the model weights anywhere. The launcher points the daemon at
#      this checkout with NR_ROOT, so the weights stay in work/mlxw/ and nothing large
#      can be passed on by accident with the game folder.
#    * It DOES copy the runtime the daemon needs to start: work/mlx-dlss (the MLX
#      extractor the daemon imports), work/libxmx.so, work/libnr_image.so and
#      work/*.spv. Without them the daemon stops at start.
#
#  Why the manifest matters: the Vulkan loader finds a layer through its manifest
#  plus VK_LAYER_PATH, and the manifest names the library as ./NAME. A path is taken
#  relative to the manifest's folder; a bare file name would be handed to dlopen, which
#  searches the system's library path and not that folder, and the layer would not load.
#
#  Usage:
#    ./deploy.sh --game /path/to/Game --dll /path/to/nvngx_dlssnr.dll
#                [--name libnr_layer.so] [--exe /path/to/Game/game]
#                [--skip-weights] [--skip-build]
